•Every application is deployed in ec2 instances with docker
•Pipeline:
	•Tickets will be created in Jira 
	•SCM used is github 
	•branches are created based on tickets 
	•Whenever a pipeline is runned there are some unit test cases for the code. The test case is given in the work flow file (in yaml script).
	•If the test case is passed, it will send notification through teams. The web-book url of teams will be given so it will send notification 
	•If the test case is passed, the build is pushed to docker build. The image tag is always latest, when new code is pushed it replaces the old version 
	•After build it is pushed to ecr repo 
	•The containers are deployed using docker compose (Deploys multiple docker containers at same time)
	•There is cron job
	•After deploy we get notification that deployes correctly
	•Containers are monitered by data dog tool (ec2, logs, applications)
	•The images have a commit id so that we can revert 
Branching strategy: 
	•Every developers has their own dev env
	•QC, Stage, pid, prod has seperate ec2 instances 
	•Changes in dev goes to qc, changes in release reflects to stage & pit, changes in master reflects to prod. 
	•Hot fix is used to make changes if there is any small error 
•All apps are in same repo. Repo name is mono
